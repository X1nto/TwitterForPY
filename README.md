# Twitter for ...  
This simple program lets you tweet via a custom "Twitter for" field  
This script uses tweepy module  

## Instructions:
First you need to create [Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com) on Twitter  
After sign up, create the new Application  
##### Note: Your application name will be important, as it will be used in "Twitter for [application name]", if you change it later, this field will still use old name, be careful when choosing a name  
After creating an application, go to Tokens tab and copy every token from there, now copy this repo and follow next steps:  
  
Open `tokenconfig.py.template` and fill out all the fields with your application tokens (do not rename this file!)  
Now open terminal and install tweepy module: `pip install tweepy`  
Run the program via `twitterfor.py`  
After you fill out everything there, congrats, you have succesfully tweeted via Gucci Smart Toilet.
